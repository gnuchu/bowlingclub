With no money available, the possibilities seemed remote&amp;nbsp;but with caps in hand, two&amp;nbsp;or three of the men approached the laird. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately they were successful in their mission&amp;nbsp;and they were given the deeds of what is still the site of the present day bowling green.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the men worked 5 and a half days a week in their day jobs leaving precious little time to devote to turning their new site into a green able to host a bowling game. Given that they also couldn&#039;t work on a Sunday their time was extremely limited. However, they managed to somehow find the time to drain, level and lay a green&amp;nbsp;and in 1922 the club opened, Duncan Grey serving as the first President.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the opening day they had a marquee, bags of enthusiasm, and little else. Over the last 94 years the many members of the club have worked hard to provide a modern clubhouse which has a well stocked bar, a pool table and a dance floor and is a place enjoyed by many of the community.&lt;/p&gt;
